# [Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD Remix](index.md) - KH2FM+ Debug Menu

The E3 2014 Kiosk Demo for Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD Remix has the developer debug menu enabled for KH2FM+. The menu works but causes crashes when attempting to use most functions intended for use with the complete game data.
By replacing the demo `index.dat` and `kingdom2.mself` with the files from a retail copy of the game it is possible to restore *most* missing functionality.

## Debug Menu Controls and Setup

To access the debug menu on a PS3 devkit or emulator, right-click on the screen with a connected mouse. To select an option left-click it in the menu. It is recommended to only use the debug menu _after_ the title screen to avoid crashes.
The following steps are recommended to improve useability:

1. Click `SUBMENU > SYSTEM > SYSTEM > VSYNC LIMIT` and choose `60`. This will set the internal frame rate to 60fps and improve mouse movement significantly when navigating the debug menu (although it still is not perfect).

2. Click `CONFIG > EDIT` and check to see if `SHOW VERSION` is enabled (it is enabled if the check box on the left is dark grey instead of light grey). If enabled, a handful of game functionality is limited to the `Premium Showcase` aspect of the demo. Disabling this option allows you to access the Camp menu when pausing, for example. Re-enabling this feature will restore the demo functions to as intended.

3. At the top of the debug menus, clicking the red (right) button will close said menu. Clicking the blue (left) button will minimize the current menu and place it at the bottom left of the screen to be quickly accessed again. Simply click that menu to maximize it.

## Detailed Breakdown of Debug Menu (Top-level)

### HIDE DEBUG

* Self-explanatory.

### STATUS >>

* Displays various realtime diagnostics, including but not limited to:
  * Player HP
  * Motion details
  * Memory/RAM usage

### CONFIG >>

* Various useful settings under ``EDIT``:
  * Movement speed
  * Player, Ally, and Enemy attack damage multipliers
  * EXP gain rate
  * Region setting (Appears to do nothing)
  * Pause mode (Appears to do nothing)
  * Various cheat options (Drive any time, infinite items, etc.)
  * Lobotomize enemy AI
  * Button turbo enable (Labelled as `ONIOSHI`)
  * And more
    * Note: The `FREE ABILITY` option appears to be mistranslated. So far it has only been seen to give Sora the *hidden* High Jump, Aerial Dodge, Glide, and Quick Run LV5 abilities (which are usually only programmed for use during the Dragoon Xemnas fight) at zero AP cost. It also forces these abilities onto all of Sora's forms, making jumping and Quick Run very dangerous to use.

### SUBMENU ON/OFF >>

* Allows docking of submenus in the top-level menu.

### SETINFO

### MAPJUMP >>

#### More documentation to come as needed

* This can be used to warp to any map in the game.
* By default, the demo is limited to maps only included in said demo. Replacing the demo's `index.dat` and `kingdom2.mself` files as explained above will rectify this limitation.
* For internal map names refer to [KH2 Worlds](../../kh2/worlds.md)
* By changing ``EVENT`` user can warp to various boss fights, scripted fights, and cutscenes.
* `PLAYER`, `FRIEND1`, `FRIEND2`, and `FRIEND3` can be used freely in most cases. I.e., making all three party members Goofy.

### LOCALSET >>

* Selecting a map prefix presents event jumps to specific events.
* Items suffixed with `_MS***` bring the player to the appropriate `MISSION` events.
  * I.e., `NM00_MS101` changes the map to NM00 (Halloween Town: Town Square) and begins the event labelled `MS101`, which is the first forced fight in the world.
* Items suffixed with `_EVENT_***` appear to initiate cutscenes that lead into certain story segments.
  * I.e., `NM_EVENT_122` shows the cutscene where Oogie has captured Santa, and Sora can now make his way to the toy factory to begin the boss fight.
  * Some of these might cause the game to crash!
* Items prefixed with `CHAP_` are cutscenes that are tied to no particular events. They appear to be what the `THEATER` menu in the retail game calls.

### PROGRESS  >>

### SIGNAL >>

### ITEM >>

An inventory editor with seemingly only one functionality: to add and remove things to and from Sora's stock. Click `BATTLE` or `SUPPORT` at the top of the menu to select various menus with different items to distribute. Left-click on an item to add one. Right-click on an item to remove one. Some items are purely cosmetic (such as HP Gain, Zantetsuken, Sync Blade, etc.) and therefore cannot be distributed outside of their respective Forms. Furthermore, certain objects in the game such as Magic and Forms are actually just items given to the player and then hidden in the items menu, which is why they are listed here.

#### Items

* `BATTLE`: Combat-usable items such as Potions and Elixers.
* `CAMP`: Items that are usable only from the Camp (Pause) menu, such as Tent, Drive Recovery, etc.
* `W_CHARCTER`: Weapons relating to the named character. E.g. `W_SORA` for a list of Sora's Keyblades.
* `ARMOR`: Armor items that can be equipped, such as Fire Bangle and Shock Charm.
* `ACCESSORY`: Ditto, but accessories such as Ability Ring and Full Bloom.
* `MIX`: Synthesis materials.
* `KEY`: Key items, such as Torn Pages, Recipes.
* `MAGIC`: Magic. (Requires a map reload. Setting these above 3 appears to do nothing.)
* `ABILITY`: Abbilities that Sora and co. can equip, including ones locked to accessories and armor. (However, these appear to not work.)
* `SUMMON`: Charms that unlock Sora's four Summons.
* `FORM`: Drive Forms for Sora to use. Includes Antiform and will even add it to the Drive list.
* `NAVIMAP`: Maps for every room in the game.
* `REPORT`: Ansem Reports.

#### Abilities (None of these appear to work.)

* `SUPPORT`: Same as `ABILITY`.
* `LIMIT`: Sora and ally limits.
* `ACTION`: Party member special attacks, such as Goofy Tornado and Tron's Scouting Disk, as well as Form-specific (cosmetic only) action abilities.
* `FORM`: Form growth abilities. Ranges from `LV1` to `MAX`.
