# [OpenKh Tool Documentation](../index.md) - KH2 Mods Manager

This document will focus on teaching you how to create mods using the OpenKH Mods Manager

## Creating a mod

A well produced mod should contain the following

* mod.yml - The format of which is explained below 
* icon.png - A 128x128 image which will be seen in the mods list
* preview.png - A image of maximum size 512 px wide by 288 px tall, which will be shown in the mod description on the right
* Other files - whatever files are needed for the mod, as defined by the mod.yml

The mod.yml file is a YAML format specification for your mod. It will contain the following fields

* `title` - The title of your mod, as displayed in the mods manager
* `description` - A description of what your mod does
* `originalAuthor` - The name of the original author who created this mod. If you just ported this mod to the modsmanager for someone else, include the original authors name.
* `logo` - The path to the icon.png
* `assets` - A list of assets that will be modified when the mod runs. See `asset types`, for details on creating an asset. Some asset types will work on any game, while others are game specific.

While you are developing a mod you can create a folder inside the "mods" directory of the mods manager release, IE

`<modsmanager release>/mods/<authorname>/<modname>`
