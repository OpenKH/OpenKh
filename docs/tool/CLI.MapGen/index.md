# [OpenKh Tool Documentation](../index.md) - MapGen

## Overview

MapGen is a tool to create `.map` file from 3D model data.

## Command usage

```bat
OpenKh.Command.MapGen.exe -h
1.0.0

Usage: OpenKh.Command.MapGen [options] <InputFile> <OutputMap>

Arguments:
  InputFile     Input file: mapdef.yml or model.{fbx,dae}
  OutputMap     Output map file

Options:
  --version     Show version information
  -?|-h|--help  Show help information
```

### Supported 3D model data formats

MapGen utilizes Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) to import 3D model data.

Thus Assimp supported formats will be usable.

See also: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/doc/Fileformats.md

### Supported 3D model data concepts

- Mesh
- Face (vertex indices)
- Vertex position (x, y, z)
- Vertex UV component (s, t)
- Vertex color (r, g, b, a)
- Material name
- Material's diffuse texture file path

### Example: fbx to map

Command line:

```bat
OpenKh.Command.MapGen.exe terrain.fbx
```

Output:

```

```

## mapdef.yml

3D model data cannot hold all of extra data needed for map conversion.
Thus write `mapdef.yml` file as needed, and place it to the same folder having 3D model data.

### Material definition

```yml
# Declare supplemental info per material of any associated meshes in 3D model data
materials:
# Pattern matching to hit a material. It ignores case.
# Accept like: `*clip`, `*old*`, `material???`
# It respects only first matched material. If there are 2 or more hits, later ones will be ignored.
- name: '*'
  fromFile: 'floor.imd'

# This never reach.
- name: 'ceil'
  fromFile: 'ceil.imd'
```

### scale

```yml
# Apply xyz uniform scale to every mesh vertex. Skipped if applyMatrix exists.
scale: 1
```

### applyMatrix

```yml
# Apply matrix for each input vertex position.
# Default is null and assume identity matrix.
applyMatrix: [
    1, 0, 0, 0, 
    0,-1, 0, 0, 
    0, 0,-1, 0, 
    0, 0, 0, 1
]

# This matrix is useful for maps exported from KH1.
```

### imageDirs

```yml
# Specify parent directory path to image files that can be used by `fromFile`
# The path accepts both absolute path, and relative path from folder having `mapdef.yml`.
# Default is `images`. If you define imageDirs, The default `images` will be lost.
imageDirs:
- 'images'
- 'images2'
- 'images3'
```

### imgtoolOptions

`OpenKh.Command.ImgTool.exe` will be used if `.png` file is passed to `fromFile`.

```yml
# Apply globally
imgtoolOptions: '-b 8'

# Apply to specific material, and override global settings.
- name: `floor`
  imgtoolOptions: '-b 8 -p'
```

### textureOptions

```yml
# Apply textureOptions globally. The individual property of textureOptions will be adopted.
textureOptions:
  # addressU
  # addressV are one of: 'Repeat', 'Clamp', 'RegionClamp', 'RegionRepeat'
  addressU: 'Repeat'
  addressV: 'Repeat'

# Apply to specific material. This overrides global setting.
- name: `floor`
  textureOptions:
    addressU: 'Repeat'
    addressV: 'Repeat'
```

### uvscList

```yml
uvscList:
  - index: 0
    u: 64000000
    v: 64000000
```

### disableTriangleStripsOptimization

```yml
# Disable triangleStrips optimization. Every output shape becomes triangle.
disableTriangleStripsOptimization: true
```

### disableBSPCollisionBuilder

```yml
# Disable BSP collision builder. Compose single huge collision table.
disableBSPCollisionBuilder: true
```

### ignore

```yml
# The mesh having this material is skipped.
- name: 'Material'
  ignore: true
```

### nodraw

```yml
# The mesh having this material is not rendered.
# But collision plane is generated.
- name: 'clip'
  nodraw: true
```

### noclip

```yml
# The mesh having this material is rendered.
# But collision plane is not generated.
- name: 'falsewall'
  noclip: true
```

### fromFile

```yml
# Specify one image file for this material.
# It uses material name as part of file name if omitted.
# For `floor`:
# - `floor.imd`
# - `floor.png`
- name: 'floor'
  fromFile: 'floor_texture.imd'
```

### surfaceFlags

```yml
# Specify `surfaceFlags` to this material.
# `0x3f1` is one of floor representation.
- name: 'floor'
  surfaceFlags: 0x3f1
```

### maxColorIntensity

maxColorIntensity: from 0 to 255

```yml
# Set maxColorIntensity globally.
maxColorIntensity: 128

# Specify maxColorIntensity to the material for overriding global settings.
# Apply max value to each RGB color component of vertex color.
- name: 'floor'
  maxColorIntensity: 128
```

### maxAlpha

maxAlpha: from 0 to 255

```yml
# Set maxAlpha globally.
maxAlpha: 128

# Specify maxAlpha to the material for overriding global settings.
# Apply max value to each Alpha color component of vertex color.
- name: 'floor'
  maxAlpha: 128
```

### transparentFlag

```yml
# Specify maxIntensity to this material.
# Set `transparentFlag: 1` to use transparency texture.
- name: 'five'
  transparentFlag: 0
```

### skipConversionIfExists

```yml
# Specify true if you want to skip png to imd conversion.
skipConversionIfExists: true
```

### reuseImd

```yml
# Specify true if you want to reuse `.imd` file converted by ImgTool.
# This is useful if diffuse texture file path is `images/tex.png`, and omit re-conversion.
reuseImd: true
```

### uvscIndex

```yml
- name: 'six'
  uvscIndex: 0
```

### bar

```yml
# Customize output bar entries for output `.map` file.
# toFile is option in case of needs to save raw data individually.
bar:
  model:
    name: "MAP"
    toFile: 'MAP_0.model'
  texture:
    name: "MAP"
    toFile: 'MAP_0.modeltexture'
  coct:
    name: "ID_e"
    toFile: 'ID_e_0.coct'
  doct:
    name: "eh_1"
    toFile: 'eh_1_0.doct'
```

### nococt

Applying `nococt: true` will skip COCT generation. default is `nococt: false`.

```yml
nococt: true
```

This is a mandatory option if we build SK0 model, because the bounding box of COCT has limitation of INT16 range (-32768 ~ 32767).

### nodoct

Applying `nodoct: true` will skip DOCT generation. default is `nodoct: false`.

```yml
nodoct: true
```

This is a mandatory option if we build SK0 model, because the bounding box of DOCT has limitation of INT16 range (-32768 ~ 32767).

### default

```yml
# This is default declaration of each material.
# And also this is used for fallback purpose.
- name: 'fallbackMaterial'
  ignore: false
  fromFile: null
  fromFile2: null
  noclip: false
  nodraw: false
  surfaceFlags: 0x3f1
  maxColorIntensity: null
  maxAlpha: null
  imgtoolOptions: null
  textureOptions:
    addressU: null
    addressV: null
```

### imageDirs and fromFile

You can specify imageDirs like:

```
imageDirs:
- 'images'
- 'images2'
- 'images3'
```

The image file associated with material will be located in this rule:

`{baseDir}/{eachInputDir}/{eachFileName}`

baseDir:

- The folder having `mapdef.yml` file.

eachInputDir:

- `images` (from `imageDirs:` section)
- `images2` (from `imageDirs:` section)
- `images3` (from `imageDirs:` section)
- The folder having `mapdef.yml` file.

eachFileName:

- `fromFile` of material (you can specify)
- `fromFile2` of material (extracted from material's diffuse texture file path as imd extension, if reuseImd set)
- `fromFile3` of material (extracted from material's diffuse texture file path)
- material name + ".imd"
- material name + ".png"


## Example of designer tools usage

- Design a full map model data with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/),
  and then export entire world to `.fbx` file format.

_Note :_ The Y coordinate is up vector in KH2.
