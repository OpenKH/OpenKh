## Documentation

All the documentation is located in the `/docs` folder in its raw form. A more web-friendly version can be accessed at: [https://openkh.dev/](https://openkh.dev/)

## Downloads

New builds of OpenKH are automatically generated every time one of the contributors inspects and approves a new proposed feature or fix. Those builds are considered stable as they are built from the `master` branch. The version format used in the builds is `YEAR.MONTH.DAY.BUILDID`.

[![OpenKh](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenKh-Download-blue.svg)](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/releases)

All the builds from `master` and from pull requestes are generated from [Azure Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/OpenKH/OpenKH/_build).

OpenKH tools require the instllation of the [.NET 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0). All the UI tools are designed to work on Windows, while command line tools will work on any operating system.
Note: All CLI and GUI programs **should** be cross-platform, though extensive testing primarily happens on Windows systems.

## OpenKH in depth

</p>

From an architectural point of view, the code is structured to abstract low-level implementation such as file parsers and infrastructural logic to high-level functionalties such as 3D rendering or tools. The projects are layered to be able to share as much as code possible, but isolated in order to avoid coupling.

From a community perspective, OpenKH will provide the best form of documentation, modding portal and fan-game support that is derived from it.

## Build from source code

The minimum requirement is [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0). Once the repository is downloaded, `build.ps1` or `build.sh` needs be executed based from the operating system in use. That is all.

## Additional info

### Future plans

* Provide a fully fledged and user friendly modding toolchain.
* Centralize modding downloads with a review system.
* Provide a friendly environment for mod users and creators alike.
* Create a community site and forum where users can openly interact with and help one another with modifications using OpenKH tools and documentation.
* Create a custom game engine that is compatible with assets from the retail games.
